                <p>
    In Greek Blast- is to bud or germanate, and -dox is a belief or ideology. Thus together the meaning, I imaginatively derive, is a growing belief that is springing forth. A belief in yourself. That you can overcome. That you can emerge from your dream chrysalis to fulfill your destiny. Or perhaps an even greater destiny will emerge. You will awaken to crack open the pupa, and attempt to stretch your wings to only suddenly realize you are a colorful tiger rather than a mere butterfly.
This website serves to guide you on your journey. To be discussed are specific methodologies that will aid you on your path such as finances, social skills, planning, and positive psychology. Above all the hats that I wear, I come from the perspective of a strategist. In the ideal form of this art one should be tactically genius, but creatively insane to think outside your opponent's box of prepared possibilities. While writing with candor, I will commit to an analytical approach to achieving goals that is entwined with the spicy magic of an insatiable imagination. Utilitarianism will be placed above idealism.
This site will also be a place to post about my general interests as in the news, create reviews, and link to other projects that I’d like to start. *Note that I’m not a fan of front-end web development, and when given the option I do not care if things look wonky in IE as this is a personal project. Also if you become confused by my cacophonous ramblings, assume that I’m joking 15% of the time. Read with the accent of the Winnie the Pooh narrator.

<h4>About the Author:</h4>
    Jonathan K. Davis, a programmer by trade, is a Christian who avidly believes in The American Dream. He grew up in The Valley of Southern California. When he was 7, his parents started giving him an allowance he equal to half his age which pushed him into an obsessive interest in saving money. He was also absorbed by video games from a young age, so naturally he elected to pursue a career in programming. At age 16 he took a community college course on C++; he also invested in his first stock: Activision. At his High School graduation he received a medal for perfect attendance all four years of High School. The only student to do so in all of the schools in the West Valley. He went to college at California Lutheran University where he received double majors and a minor respectively in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Multimedia. Through the four years of college, he was also employed by CLU’s IT department where he developed a passion for troubleshooting complex problems. With a hefty scholarship and assistance from his parents he graduated with positive savings. In the deepest part of the recession it was difficult for him to find more than internships, and took him 6 months until he found his first fulltime Software Development job. As home prices continued to slid to the bottom, at the age of 23 he saved up enough money to buy a townhouse close to his his Alma Mater in the affluent city of Thousand Oaks. The plan being to rent out the extra rooms. The market timing was perfect, and his net worth skyrocketed with the upward market trend. Several years later with more programming under his belt, he moved to tropical Honolulu to pursue new opportunities.</p>
<p>He also listens to Gangster Rap.</p>

<p>His future goals are to accumulate enough liquidity to pay off his townhouse by 2019 (but then invest rather than paying it off.) By 2024 he plans on being a millionaire, and retire from working for anyone but himself. The underlying objective is to fund missionaries abroad via passive income. He would also like a wife and kids.</p>

<p>These are the credentials of a patient man who knows how to methodically overcome all forms of barriers to accomplish anything that he dares to dream.</p> 

<p>But this is only the skin layer of an onion. Beneath is the duality of man. Weakness. Social anxiety that took a decade to overcome. Even further is constant failure. Those who find the most success are those that have failed the most, and not given up. At the core of this metaphorical onion, is a cunning strategist with the persistent patience to see out any plan.</p>

<h4>Name Explanations... These are factual ways that people refer to me:</h4> Those who hold me in high reverence often refer to me by the concept of “JKD”; more than a nickname but an entity of maxims that I strive to represent. The JKD ethos is akin to Marshawn Lynch’s Beast Mode persona. “Jonathan K. Davis” is also often used, and similarly follows in the awe notion of the “JKD” concept. It is said slowly, often rhythmically, and savored similarly to the feeling of squeezing edamame pods. On the other hand is “Jon,” as I myself that is the non-third-person-friendly form used in personal close regard of my normal person. “Jonathan” is used by those talking factually while not implying closeness. “Jon Jon” is the most rarely used form that is said with sweet closeness, such as by girls. *Not to be confused with the GPS system Tom Tom. Jon the Magic Juan is reserved by certain person(s).
